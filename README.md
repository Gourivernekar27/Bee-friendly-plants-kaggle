# 🐝 Bee-Friendly Plants – Classification & Analysis

![Bee Friendly Plants](image.png)

This project earned **1st place** in the [DataCamp Bee Friendly Plants Competition](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/competitions/bee-friendly-plants), where participants built machine learning models to classify bee-friendly plants.  
The solution was selected for its balance of performance, clarity, and insight.

## 🌸 Overview

The goal of this project was to classify plants as bee-friendly or not, based on ecological and botanical features.  
It contributes to broader efforts around biodiversity, pollination, and environmental sustainability.

## 🔬 Approach

### 🔧 Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values and outliers
- Scaled and normalized numeric features
- Encoded categorical variables (e.g., flower color, bloom time)

### 🧩 Feature Engineering
- Created new features based on botanical knowledge
- Identified most predictive variables for bee-friendliness

### 🤖 Model Building
- Tested models: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks
- Tuned hyperparameters using Grid Search and Random Search
- Validated using k-fold cross-validation

### 📊 Evaluation
- Evaluated with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Selected model with optimal balance of performance and interpretability
